## Project Overview
### :heavy_check_mark: Reasoning for Project
We chose this topic because we are all from Austin and we wanted to learn more about the city we live in. In doing so, we wanted to learn more about the crime data in Austin and how we can use data from previous years to predict the propensity of crime in the future. Our team believes one of the ways to prevent crime is to be able to predict crime. We believe this project will help us better understand the crime data in Austin and how we can use it to predict crime in the future.

### :heavy_check_mark: Predictions we hope to answer with the data
We hope to answer the following questions with our data predictions:
* What type of crime is most likely to occur in Austin?
* What time of day is most likely to have a crime occur?
* What day of the week is most likely to have a crime occur?
* What month of the year is most likely to have a crime occur?
* What is the most likely location for a crime to occur?
