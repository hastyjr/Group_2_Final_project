## Project Overview
### :heavy_check_mark: Reasoning for Project
    We chose this topic because we are all from Austin and we wanted to learn more about the city we live in. In doing so, we wanted to learn more about the crime data in Austin and how we can use data from previous years to predict the propensity of crime in the future. Our team are true believers in the fact that in order to prevent crime, we need to be able to predict crime. We believe this project will help us to better understand the crime data in Austin and how we can use it to predict crime in the future.
### ‚úîÔ∏è Communication Protocols
Our group utilized Slack to communicate with each other and a shared Google doc to consolidate ideas and outline steps of the analysis. We met twice a week to go over our progress, discuss and resolve any questions, and plan different stages of the project.
### :heavy_check_mark: Description of Data Source
### data source: https://data.austintexas.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/fdj4-gpfu
    The data source we chose is the Austin Crime Data from 2010-2020. This data set contains 1,000,000+ rows of data and 13 columns. The data set contains information about the type of crime, the date and time of the crime, the location of the crime, and the address of the crime. The data set also contains information about the type of weapon used in the crime, the type of offense, the type of family violence, and the type of location. The data set also contains information about the type of district, the type of census tract, and the type of neighborhood. The data set also contains information about the type of clearance status, the type of clearance date, and the type of UCR code. The data set also contains information about the type of UCR description, the type of X coordinate, and the type of Y coordinate. The data set also contains information about the type of latitude, the type of longitude, and the type of location.
We used data from the Austin Police Department's website. The data was in the form of a csv file. The data was from 2010 to 2019.
### :heavy_check_mark: Predictions we hope to answer with the data
We hope to answer the following questions with our data:
- What are the most common crimes in Austin?
- What are the most common crimes in Austin by year?
- What are the most common crimes in Austin by month?
- What are the most common crimes in Austin by day of the week?

## ‚úîÔ∏è Machine Learning Model
Two machine learning models will be created to find patterns in Austin crime data and make predictions of future criminal activity. Each model will be instantiated, trained using a percentage of the crime dataset, evaluated for accuracy, recall, and precison and then optimized before model deployment. Some machine learning models considered include the following:
- Logistic Regression Model to determine the input variable's probability of belonging to one of two groups
- Random Forest Model uses decisions trees and their combined output to make a classification or regression decision and can rank the performance of features

We hope to use machine learning models to accurately predict if a crime would be classified as Family Violence or not.
